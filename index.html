             <div class="header"><h2>INTRODUCTION</h2></div>
            <p class="content">The main concept behind the Vision Protector using Arduino project is to keep the
                chidren at safe distance from tv screen. I have used Ultrasonic Sensor for detection of
                children or adult one when they come near to tv-screen, we have used servo motor on
                which ultrasonic senor is attached which rotate like radar system to detect and verify
                children or adult one.
                two simiar design of radar sysytem has been instaled whenever the radar at top detect
                something most probably the adult and mature person is near the tv-screen so no beep
                sound is made but if only lower radar sysytem detect any thing then that may be children
                so beep sound till he/she goes back</p>

            <div class="header"><h2>PROBLEM STATEMENT</h2></div>
            <p class="content">Many parents struggle to impose healthy limits on themselves so how can we expect they
                care well about their children. The average adult spends over 11 hours per day behind a
                screen, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Although many parents use TV to
                wind down before bed, screen time before bed can backfire. The light emitted from
                screens interferes with the sleep cycle in the brain and can lead to insomnia and also
                vision problem. in many cases working parents leave their children at home so there is a
                high possibilty that the children will watch tv and that too from very near to tv-screen.
                Hence, such a system has to be build which can eradicate this problem or at least reduce
                it to the minimum level. This project gives us one of the most efficient ways to keep
                children at safe distance from tv-screen. By using this vision protector we atleast insure
                that children is not watching tv from much nearer to screen</p>
        </div>
        <div class="same">
            <div class="header"><h2>OBJECTIVES</h2></div>
            <p class="content">As we always hear prevention and protection is better than cure so, the main objective of
                this project is to maintain a safe distance from tv-screen so as to protect our eye and
                prevent loss or blur of eye sight. Nowadays people are busy in their works and they forgot
                to take care of their children and children likes to sit near tv-screen while whatching tv
                and that causes serious eye problem and also causes negative effect on health and
                psychology of children. So This paper presents an Arduino based vision protector . The
                Arduino Uno controller is used to read the presense of childrenwith the help of Ultrasonic
                sensor. After detecting the children the buzzer makes noise till the time child is near the
                screen . Arduino Nano used has Atmega328p-pu old version IC. . Embedded C is used to
                program the controller</p>
        </div>
        <div class="same">
            <div class="header"><h2>WORKING</h2></div>
            <p class="content">After setting up the Vision Protector and making all the necessary connections, upload the
                code to Arduino and provide 5V power supply to the circuit. Once the system is powered
                ON, Arduino keeps monitoring for any object near the Ultrasonic Sensor If the Ultrasonic
                Sensor at lower level detects anything then we look at ultrasonic sensor at upper level if
                nothing is detected then Arduino will activate the buzzer and will start to make beep
                sound till the time the object is within the range. else if upper level ultrasonic sensor also
                detect anything then normal function will continue and no beep sound or any disturbance
                made as the height is higher and detected one can’t be child.

            <div class="header"><h2>RESULTS</h2></div>
            <p class="content">Whenever the child of height less than lower level set by us comes in range of tv-screen
                that we have sat the disturbance is created and will contunue making beep sound till the
                time the child is there and beep sound stop once the child went back and moves out of
                range that we set. Now if a person with min height the upper level of ultrasonic sensor set
                up comes in range than we won’t observe any beep sound or disturbance .as the creteria
                that we used here to distinguish between adult and child is height.
                we also thought of first prviding warning by blinking led and then turning off the tv if no
                montion detected for certain time but unfortunity due to malfunctionong of PIR sensor we
                had to drop that functionality.</p>

            <ul class="content" style="list-style-type:none;">
                <li>Continuously power supply/using battery</li>
                <li> Malfunctioning of electronics components</li>
                <li>Currently no AI,for proper detection children and there is also edge
                    condition like putting paper on upper level ultrasonic sensor as one of them.</li>

        <div class="same">
            <div class="header"><h2>FUTURE WORK</h2></div>
            <p class="content">The AIoT fusion to enable devices to learn, reason, and process information like humans
                so that proper detection of children and also to off tv to save power if there is no one in
                the room.
                Add more function to provide variety of features like sending proper data like for how
                much time child had watched tv and turning off tv after certain limit and many more
                related functionality</p>
